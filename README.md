Late night console-app :)
A simple console game modeled on the well-known game show "Millionaires". Questions loaded from .txt file.
Short rules of the game:
12 questions, the last one is for a million.
We have 2 "lifebuoys" that save us when we choose the wrong answer.
The player answers the question in the form of numbers from 1 to 4, which are assigned to the order of the displayed answers.
